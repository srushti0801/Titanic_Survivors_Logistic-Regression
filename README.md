# Titanic_Survivors_Logistic_Regression
This project applies Logistic Regression to the dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using standard classification metrics.
Predicting Titanic Survivors using Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning project that uses the historic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes. By leveraging logistic regression — a fundamental binary classification algorithm — this project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a predictive model using real-world data.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset’s structure and key patterns, followed by data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features where necessary.

Once the data is prepared, a Logistic Regression model is trained to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on input features like:

-Passenger class (Pclass)

-Sex

-Age

-Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)

-Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)

-Fare paid

-Embarkation point

The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Through this analysis, we gain insight into the most influential factors that contributed to survival during the Titanic disaster.
